## Prompt 1/5: Project Foundation & Core UI Shell

### 1. Persona / Role Assignment

Act as a senior full-stack web developer and 3D visualization expert with over 15 years of experience. You specialize in React, Three.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. You are tasked with initiating "The Philosophical Nexus" project. Your initial focus is on establishing a robust project structure and implementing the static UI shell according to a specific "cassette-futurism" aesthetic. The user is a product visionary, so ensure the foundation is clean and well-organized.

### 2. Project Vision

The Philosophical Nexus is a transformative, interactive 3D web application that democratizes philosophy. Its core purpose is to make the interconnectedness of philosophical history tangible, helping users understand the evolution of thought, articulate their own beliefs, and visualize harmonies or conflicts in their worldview. The entire experience is wrapped in a retro cassette-futurism aesthetic to evoke 80s synthwave immersion.

### 3. User Story & Functional Requirements

- As a project owner, I want the initial application shell to be created with the correct tech stack and brand identity, so that future feature development can build upon a stable and visually consistent foundation.
  - Requirements:
    - Initialize a new React project using Vite
    - Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Create the main application layout component
    - The layout must feature a central area for the 3D orb and side panels for information and interaction (static placeholders for now)
    - Implement the global background styles, including noise, grid overlay, and CRT scanlines effect

### 4. Scope

- In-Scope:
  - Create the complete project directory structure: `/app`, `/components`, `/scenes`, `/api`, `/styles`
  - Set up a new React application with Vite
  - Configure `tailwind.config.js` with the project's specific fonts and colors
  - Create a main `App.jsx` layout component
  - Create a reusable `Panel.jsx` component for UI sections
  - Implement global CSS for the background, fonts, and CRT/grid overlays
- Out-of-Scope:
  - Any 3D rendering or Three.js integration
  - Any backend logic or Supabase integration
  - Any user interactivity (clicks, forms, etc.)
  - The content of the panels will be placeholder text

### 5. Brand Identity & Design Specifications

- Typography:
  - Primary: `VT323` (monospace, chunky), 14px for labels, 18px for headers
  - Secondary: `Press Start 2P`, 12px for tooltips

## Prompt 2/5: Layer 1 - The Historical Orb (Visuals & Data)

### 1. Persona / Role Assignment

Act as a senior full-stack web developer and 3D visualization expert. You are continuing work on "The Philosophical Nexus." Having established the project's foundation, your current task is to implement the primary visual element of Layer 1: the 3D Historical Orb. You will use Three.js to create the orb and populate it with placeholder data.

### 2. Project Vision

The Philosophical Nexus is an interactive 3D web application for exploring philosophy. Layer 1, the Historical Orb, is the entry point, designed to make the interconnectedness of philosophical history tangible and visually navigable. This step focuses on creating the static, non-interactive version of this vision.

### 3. User Story & Functional Requirements

- As a user, I want to see a 3D orb representing the history of philosophy, so I can visually grasp its structure.
  - Requirements:
    - Render a 3D scene within the central area of the main layout
    - The scene must contain a large, wireframe sphere (the orb)
    - The orb should be divided into five conceptual "slices" (Logic, Aesthetics, Ethics, Politics, Metaphysics)
    - Inside the orb, display a set of nodes representing individual philosophers
    - The orb should be rotatable and zoomable using mouse controls
    - Use placeholder data to populate the philosopher nodes

### 4. Scope

- In-Scope:
  - Create a new Three.js scene component: `/scenes/HistoricalOrb.jsx`
  - Integrate this component into the main `App.jsx`, replacing the central placeholder
  - Create a placeholder data file: `/app/data/philosophers.json`
  - Implement the wireframe sphere, slice visualizations, and philosopher nodes using Three.js
  - Add basic camera controls for rotation and zoom
- Out-of-Scope:
  - Advanced interactivity (clicking slices, fractillion traces, helix transformation)
  - Backend integration (data will be loaded from a local JSON file)
  - Implementation of Layers 2 and 3

### 5. Brand Identity & Design Specifications

- Orb Style: The main sphere must be a `Phosphor Green` (`#00FF00`) wireframe on the black background
- Node Style: Philosopher nodes should be small, solid green spheres with a slight glow effect
- Slices: Represent the five metaphysical slices with subtle visual cues, such as colored arcs or lines on the sphere's surface

### 6. Technical Specifications

- Framework/Libraries: Use React and Three.js with `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for React integration
- Data Structure: The `/app/data/philosophers.json` file should contain an array of philosopher objects with `id`, `name`, `era`, and `position` ([x, y, z] coordinates)
- 3D Implementation:
  - Use `SphereGeometry` and `WireframeGeometry` for the orb
  - Use `SphereGeometry` with `MeshBasicMaterial` for the nodes
  - Use `OrbitControls` from `@react-three/drei` for camera movement

### 7. Examples

Follow this pattern for creating the basic Three.js orb:
```jsx
// /scenes/HistoricalOrb.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

const Orb = () => {
  return (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry args={[3, 32, 32]} />
      <meshBasicMaterial color="#00FF00" wireframe />
    </mesh>
  );
};

export default function HistoricalOrbScene() {
  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 8], fov: 60 }}>
      <Orb />
      <OrbitControls enablePan={false} />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

### 8. Output Instructions

1. First, provide a brief plan on how you will integrate `@react-three/fiber` into the existing Vite project
2. Next, generate the full code for the new and modified files: `App.jsx` (to include the canvas), `scenes/HistoricalOrb.jsx`, and the data file `data/philosophers.json`
3. Finally, list the new npm dependencies required (`three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`)
