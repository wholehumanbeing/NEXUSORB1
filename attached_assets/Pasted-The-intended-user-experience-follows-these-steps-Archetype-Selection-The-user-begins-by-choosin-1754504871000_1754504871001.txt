The intended user experience follows these steps:

Archetype Selection: The user begins by choosing 3 out of 12 alchemical symbols.
Initial Configuration: Based on the symbol choice, the system assigns the user one of 84 unique Archetypes. This archetype sets the initial shape of the 10-sided crystal, representing a biased starting philosophical stance.
Shape Manipulation: The user directly interacts with the 3D shape, adjusting their philosophical positions.
Dynamic Answers: As the shape is manipulated, the system generates contextually appropriate answers to philosophical questions in real-time.
Cascade Effects: Locking a stance on one axis can trigger "ripple effects," causing other axes to adjust to maintain a coherent philosophical worldview.
Philosopher Comparison: The system allows users to overlay the philosophical "shapes" of historical philosophers (like Plato or Spinoza) onto their own for comparison.
The Archetype System
The Archetype is a foundational concept in the system, representing a distinct philosophical starting point or personality. Each archetype is defined by a unique combination of symbols, which in turn assigns an initial philosophical question and starting configuration. The knowledge base contains two sets of data for archetypes, which are combined below.

Note on Symbols: The knowledge base contains two different sets of symbols. The archetypeSystem files use alchemical metals (e.g., silver, mercury, iron). The archetypeStarterNodes.ts file uses a more diversified list of mythological and geometric symbols (e.g., Ouroboros, Ankh, Mandala).
