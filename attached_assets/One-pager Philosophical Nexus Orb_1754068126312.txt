One-pager: Philosophical Nexus Orb
1. TL;DR
The Philosophical Nexus Orb is a web-based, interactive 3D visualization platform that transforms 2,500+ years of philosophical history into an explorable spatial universe. Primary users are university philosophy students and autodidacts who struggle to grasp interconnections between thinkers and ideas across time periods. The product solves cognitive overload by replacing text-heavy study methods with an intuitive, visually rich interface featuring nested spheres, animated relationship traces, and contextual AI assistance.

3. User stories
Primary Persona: Maya, Philosophy Undergraduate

As a student studying Kant's ethics, I want to quickly see how his ideas influenced later utilitarian thinkers so I can write a comparative essay
As someone struggling with dense readings, I want to visually explore idea relationships so I can build intuitive understanding before diving into primary texts
Secondary Persona: Dr. Chen, Philosophy Professor

As an educator, I want to demonstrate the evolution of epistemological thought so my students can see continuity across centuries
As a researcher, I want to identify lesser-known connections between thinkers so I can develop novel research angles
Tertiary Persona: Alex, Curious Generalist

As an intellectually curious person, I want to explore philosophical landscapes casually so I can satisfy my curiosity without academic pressure

6. Narrative
Maya opens her laptop Tuesday evening, dreading another dense Kantian ethics reading. Instead of diving straight into the Groundwork, she launches the Philosophical Nexus Orb. The 3D universe materializes—a constellation of interconnected minds spanning millennia.

She spots Kant's distinctive blue ethics sphere in the Enlightenment layer and clicks. Suddenly, golden trace lines illuminate, revealing his influence rippling forward to Mill, backward to Aristotle, and sideways to contemporary bioethicists she's never heard of. "Wait," she thinks, "Kant influenced environmental ethics?"

She follows a silver critique line from Nietzsche—who apparently had strong opinions about Kantian duty—then transforms to helix view to see the temporal flow of moral philosophy. Within fifteen minutes, she's built an intuitive mental map that would have taken hours of cross-referencing footnotes.

When she finally opens the Groundwork, Kant's ideas don't feel isolated anymore. They're part of a living conversation across centuries, and Maya can finally see her place in it.
